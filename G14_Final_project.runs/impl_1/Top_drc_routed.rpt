Gated clock check  
Net ready_obstacle_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ready_obstacle_reg_i_2/O, cell ready_obstacle_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
